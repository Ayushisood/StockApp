## Note : For API to call, API_KEY was required but it had limit of 25 requests per day which got exhausted and new api-key is not getting generated by the platform (message : Success success - redundant origins.)

### Hence api-key = 'demo' has been used in the project to make it work with the api response. <strong>But Implemented proper caching to cache API responses and avoid extra API calls.</strong>

### I even tried generating new API key next day, but on the very first request it gave me 25 requests exhausted. 

### If you wish to run the code using your own API key, please change the API key in the API calls in following files:
 - AppNavigator.tsx
 - DetailScreen.tsx

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
